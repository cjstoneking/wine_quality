## Overview

In this project, I analyze a publically available [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/) to try to determine which factors influence the quality of wine. As a challenge, I try to do so using only the linear model (lm) as a base classifier, and use various feature generation and ensembling strategies to improve its performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Classification

The variable we want to predict is quality, which is numeric and integer-valued.
